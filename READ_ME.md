The order in which the notebooks were written: 

- fourier_analysis_notbook (slightly hacky version of things to come)
- generate_random_phase
- filtering_basics
- Van_der_ven_filters (then went back to a section for filtering_basics)
- funcs.py (consolidated some functions for convenience)
- filtering_spectrum
